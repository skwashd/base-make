Base Drupal 7 Make File

This is the drush make file used for Dave Hall Consulting builds. I use this 
make file as a foundation for all of my sites. I'm sharing this make file so 
others can learn from me and I can get feedback.

Some entries in the make file are used for many of my site builds, but they
aren't appropriate for all builds. These modules have been retained to make it
easier to include them.

I originally developed this file while working as the Principal Engineer at 
Technocrat.

This file will be updated periodically. Please submit suggestions and 
improvements using the github issue tracker.
